In recent years, our group has remained continually dedicated to enhancing our collective awareness and improving the overall literacy on inclusive workspaces through the efforts of the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accountability (IDEA) task force. Our primary motivation in setting up such a working group was aimed at promoting a shared vision on what we as a research group viewed our workplace to be; i.e., a safe space where ideas, suggestions, and conversations

## Inception

During the Women's day celebration event [add date - 2023], all of the women scientists in the group gave short presentations on their research work along with discussing some of the challenges faced as a women scientist in academia. These shared experiences were followed by a longer discussion within the group on how we could make our workplace safe for everyone. These discussions were the primary source of motivation to start a grassroots movement to support this vision of an equitable and representative working group. And thus, the IDEA-taskforce was born through our collective need to improve our research group's commitment to these IDEAls (pun-intended!).

Some of our motivation also stems from our observation that within academia a lot of us are trained to be researchers but there is inadequate (and sometimes completely absent) training provided centrally as part of the hiring process as a researcher. Additionally, the hierarchical structure and distribution of power within academia limits democratic decision making. By discussing these and other pressing issues pervasive within most academic institutions our motivation is to re-educate ourselves and make small but consistent change in the right direction. 

## We are not experts!

While the working group is continually engaged in promoting the IDEA topics within the group, we as a group recognize that we are not experts in these areas. We have consistently requested feedback from the research group that has helped us in more ways than we could have imagined. It has been our experience that without this support from within the group, such an ongoing push would not have come to fruition. We have continuously improved, adapted, and learned how to bring about the best possible change with the smallest actions/events.
