## Minutes

- First thing would be to discuss when we should meet for a group wide meeting
	- Exam week would be an option i.e., account for people who are giving a course
	- Week number 8 would be better according to Ken Wed. or Fri. not too 
	  early in the morning
	- The week of 15th of Jan.

- Something light again using the cards that Jantien gave us and something perhaps bigger
  for womens day approx. two months later

- Book reading "Arise" basically read 

- Some input we received for the last session
	- Everyone felt they could speak and expressions
	- We could improve our time management and the technical issues
	- Speed dating/communication would be easier even with online people being

- How to foster psyc. safety in academia
	- 4 type of cards
	- Giving people a problem and then we come as a group(s) with a solution
	- Customise the questions based on the what is more relevant for us
	- Do we know if a bigger set is available for the cards

- For now we read through the cards then we can meet up again and then decide on the 
  specifics

- Who are we planning to get for womens day?
	- Jantien shared a group of female professors in the NL
	- Athena's Angels (women in science group!) [Maybe table for now since its a big
	  ask to visit Delft and speak to a small group -- Ken]
	- Ask Athena for advice as opposed to request them to come and meet

- **TO DO** Email about the last time people were missing!
	- Say this is as important as any other meeting we attend as part of the group
	- Perhaps Jantien MUST say this then it has another perspective and importance
	- Maybe we need to clarify why we do this and share our beliefs and why participating
	  in these meetings are community building wihtin the group
	- Sending the DEI meeting invites 
	- Prof. Seyran Khademi perhaps could be a good point of contact with having context
	  about BK and all that goes around here.
	- We could consider reaching out via social media channels to connect with DEI efforts
	- Perhaps we could post things we do wihtin the group
	- Do we know someone working in DEI (perhaps we all can look into this!!!). Find some
	  companies that do diversity training etc for a small group


Ken - googling
Gina - Contact Athena's Angles
Nadine - Writes the email
Akshay - Scans the cards and comes up with new Q's/cards
