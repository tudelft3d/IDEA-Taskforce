- We already contacted the game forum that nadine shared (check the name!)

- How do we plan the meeting?
	- Lets plan for a longer 2 hr slot 
	- ????If we should do speed dating and/or a group session?????
	- Nadine: We should have a social media coverage of these events (good point!)
	- Maybe DEI events on the website itself. 
	- Lets make it a task to take pictures and document more of the DEI events we are 
	  planning/doing/etc
	- Hopefully someone else from the university will reach out to us. 
- Discuss what the specific focus cards to be on??
	- Safety in the workplace entails a lot of sub-topics, but what do we want to get
	  out of it?
	- Integrity in the workplace workplace: How would you/or this person should have
	  reacted in a given situation? (Gina)
	- What would be the main message that we would like to get across?
	- Cluster the cards into specific focus things: Safety at the workplace
		- Heirarcy and dealing with the structure?
		- Only female in the course and how that reflects on the system and development
	- Tentatively: 20 mins for lunch, 20 mins for into + closure
		       leaves us with 1hr 20 mins for the session
	- Akshay will start a document on overleaf to collaborate on coming up with the card
	  ideas.
	- one party might take over the conversation so how do we setup the mechanism to avoid that
		- So the Q's are already a mechanism to avoid this
		- Already prescribe the role for one person and they coordinate
		- Nadine's Dutch class idea for the conversation started and sustainer!***
	- First poll and ensure that people are coming in so get can estimate.
	- Postpone end of year lunch to start of year lunch (Week of the 8th) and the DEI event
	  will then be the next week i.e., week of 15th Jan. 2024


-- Heirarcy problem how to speak up (Perhaps we need a different activity for this!)
-- Stereotyping in colloquial conversations (micro-agressions)


- Make sure in the next meeting we discuss the book club plan and ideas to make it affordable
