## Downside up 

- [G.S.] The pricing model is not that steep
- Perhaps to generic, and the aim might have been too noviced!
- The focus is mainly on creating awareness and identifying issues within the group, but perhaps our aim should be to reiterating and using our strengths within the group and identify that. And being vulnerable within the group 

- [N] 
    - Perhaps we meet with them and actually have an agenda [Perhaps we have a concrete agenda of what we want out of it!!]
        - Subscription -- Identify the issues and then work on them. But this would be more informative if we need a closure after this as that might open doors that might need closing....
        - Perhaps we should discuss and talk about things as approach in this perspective...
    - Or we simply say no and then search for something else
- [G-J] 
    - Perhaps there are better options outside and other than downside up
- [N]
    - Perhaps we shoudl aim for team building 
    - DEI usually assumes there is an issue
- How to we know for sure we are novice about this situation
    - We have had some conversations, and this what we have and the sessions are aimed at? 
    - What are we searching for really??

- The issue is about feeling comfortable with them and not exposing our group culture.
- Perhaps we should have discussed the agenda of meeting and had more concrete items. Highlight this point
    - We should itemise the issues and items we need to work on
    - Raising awareness is a continual effort
    - Better to make it anonymous and have a collective efforts
    - We are (not novice) but we have taken the first step towards the training

- So we go with the game only
- We dont celebrate on the same day as DEWIS day
    - Pub-Quiz perhaps 
    - Collectively present one thing
    - Nadine checks with all the women in the office and potentially on the 21st of March.
    - Gina sending out the placeholder.
    - Book a room and catering once we have a room and confirmation
- Pre-meeting with all the women
    - Meeting to discuss a detailed plan
- Perhaps we should focus on the issues that we face hardships on discussing in the things we do
- Some options were to be more receptive about issues/problems that are sometimes not considered an issue.
    - Active listening is not the same as solving problems and providing suggestions

- Meet again and decide on the final stance!!

- DEI event per week
    - Share an exper.
    - Say 3 people work together to do something nice per week
    - Could be something really simple and easy
    - How to do it once in while and enforce it
    - What can I do this week to make it better :)
- IDEA [Inclusive, Diversity, Equity, and Accountability]
    - Self-accountability towards contributing to the ideas
