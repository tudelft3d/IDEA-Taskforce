[N] What should we do about Downside up?
[G] 	- What kind of goals do we want to achive?

It is unclear if we should

- We could reach out to the DEI office within TU Delft
- Link to DEI TUD: https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/diversiteit-en-inclusie/di-staff
	- Perhaps Fatima or Vasileia (Gina is acquainted with them and Jantien with both)
- The next first meeting is to cover the very basic aspects of the IDEA
- Every game has a specific target
- How to tackle getting people up 2 speed and how do we maintain the coherence.
	- We always fall back on the goals
- What kind of culture do we want?
	- These should be collective goals
	- Create a common language/framework
	- Letting people know what our group represents
	- This could be an event****
	- One example that Jantien is willing to share (on the group already shared!)
