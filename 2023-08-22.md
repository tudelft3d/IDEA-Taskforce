# DEI Discussion [Ken, Nadine, Gina, Akshay] - 22nd-Aug-2023 - 15:00 to 16:00

- Starting with Gina's original question "Check telegram for reference content" 
- Introvert vs. Extrovert 
    - How to voice opinion the best way?
    - Perhaps not feeling safe to express is one opinion (Nadine)
    - Too much pressure? to be "wrong, incorrect, etc" and how it would be perceived by everyone. 
- It seems like some people feel like it may not be a safe place to express opinions

- Example: Covid pandemic and vaccinations as a good example. Grading between very silly to very serious content.
    - Vocal, Dogmatic, very critical, hard opinions and a lack of dissent, power structure, how to deal with that when expressing on the chat?
    - There is a lack of effort for organic discsusions 

Gina Q => How to approach the meeting itself? As a active discssuion and then work towards the discussion giving everyone some time.
    - Example: opinions != facts that could a way to deal with the meeting
    - Lower the barrier for interaction (Ken) through various community discussions
    - How to address the power dynamics?

DEI training, what are they really going to talk about?

- Some experience with racism, xenophobic, etc. issues within the group. Additionally, there are things happening outside the chat itself.
- How do we motivate everyone to be open for conversation?
    - Foster a sense of belonging to the group
    - People and the environment | how we can deal with the conversation

- Take examples from outside and then relate them to our situations
- Include more people in the discussion during the context setup
- Perhaps underline the fact that you can freely reach out the person with whome something "wrong" occured and then deal with the next steps
- Do not put other people down and do not bring too much attention to something or some behavior
    - Example: If you have an opinion on something, then you can be pressured into answering. One example being the vaccine.
- Maybe start with an ice-breaker to get everyone included (Gina will try to look for some suggestions)
