    4. We should keep the carpet forever
    5. Travel to the past for a single day or impose one global law. 

### Number of debates: 3

### How will we present the topic

- Nadine: “In order to learn how to respect each other we need to fight each other”,
- Ken: Important to talk about why we are doing that. "This is the problem, this is why we need to practice how to..."
- Akshay: I can make some slides about the comments we have received from people not feeling comfortable speaking their mind in the group


### Timing & Rules:
 - we should set time limit/person but not specific rules. 
 - Time: 5’ for presentation. Then 3 session with 5' breaks: 15’ 5’ 15’ 5’ 15’ 
- RULES: Be respectful & stick to the time. Be constructive 
- Moderators: Ones keeps the score, one keeps the time. 
- We should switch sides only at the last debate. 

### How many groups?
 - Gina We should divide them in groups of 5-6,  or just in half
 - Ken it is important for them to be able to express to a bigger group 
- We make a decision closer to the date when we know number of participants. 



### Reward
Nadine: Should we have a reward? Something lame > Gina: will have a look


### Closing
 - Gina: How to we close this? 
 - Nadine: We should do an debriefing 
 - We should make them fill in an online form before going. 
 - Akshay: Example: I learned something in the session.  Totally agree 10 to 0 totally disagree. 



### Idea for next time: Speed debates.


## TODO:

### Nadine: 
Will book room, arrange catering, send an invitation, read the first aid kit. 

### Akshay: 
will lead the session and will do the presentation, prepare the slides, add some information about how to be constructive (but like a game, light-hearted). Will do the debriefing (summary etc) at the end by highlighting good examples. 

### Gina: 
Will look for lame rewards, make the form for feedback, think of a question for measuring the impact of DEI initiatives. Will be stressed that the feedback form is for us, for measuring the impact. Will see if she can bring relevant boardgame.

Also we need to prepare cards for "Hell yeah!", " Absolutely no"
