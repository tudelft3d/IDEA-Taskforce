# Meeting with Downside Up about the DEI event
 --- Jantien, Ken, Gina, Nadine, Akshay + Downsideup ---

- Started with the introduction about everyone
- Nadine took one of their courses in the past
- Laurens walks around the campus to train PhD students and also has some technical background
  with later focus on psych. health and helped design the game along with Jip.
- Nadine summarised the need for DEI and events
	- Started with Womens's day where it all started
	- Raise awareness of all the problems
	- We did not want to preach but instead practice along with the group. Thus the need
	  for some outside training.
- (L) What would be the focus and who are being trained here?
	- Approx. 30 peers that would require the training
	- How do we perform as a group but we are looking for internal dynamics within the 
	  group...
	- We do not have a specific date on mind but would be open for one or more sessions
	  if required....
- Does the group have a vision about DEI within the group?
	- First focus is within the group to improve and understand our own biases
	- (Jip) Are there specific things that we are trying to focus on??
- (Jant.) We are looking for insights and not really solving any exisiting problems....
	- Happy to hear from downsideup on ideas what could be done??
- (Jip) Understand focus areas that can be improved 
- (L) (10 blocks) Workculture canvas -- What kind of behavior we encourage or discourage as a group??
	- Can be translated to the individual perception?
	- Do we have certain rituals? Operationally how are decisions made?
	  Does expertise play a role? What are the rules are kind** of obey?
	  Implicit rules about (say) being late*** 
	  Small little things that could become a part of hte culture***
	  Evalutate how happy are we with the current situation??? and how can we set the priority
	  and decide on the rules for these things...
	- This could be a starting point for the discussions
	- Has different topics within DEI, so what could focus within the group
	  using this as a understanding tool as oppsoed to education (game usage)
- Canvas is not done via a game, but the game has a more interpersonal relational part
  canvas is a more rational part.
- How to get the canvas ( Make together with the team, what are we doing right now)
	- Being it all together and identify which parts we like to focus on
	- Think on making new agreemnts on chaning (say one thing) -- For a few weeks
	- Strength of this canvas -- Gives the group a chance to be involed collectively
	  and then make a decision on a very group level (personal) discussion. Make everyone
	  the owner of this trajectory.
	- During this session, how easy do we find to have these discussions
	- There is curiosity but perhaps there are unsaid things we have not addressed
	- (Jip) both tools are diagnostic tool
- (G) Is this one session or different sessions. Subject to how we want to spend the session??
- (Laur.) have dialogue about say what we mean psyc. safe, meaning does not mean we be challenged
	- Do we recognise where we draw the boundaries??
	- Provoke someone in a systematic way
	- Different methods to recognise and address these responses...
- Working format*** over the line/across the line
	- To identify alignment in the team
	- Few statements and then alignment with the statements
- Different starting levels about DEI exposure and understanding
- Is there a sensitive topic already we are aware of...

- First session then we can explore how to create a blueprint...

- Format of the session how is it setup
	- How easy would it be to participate?
	- (L) We can keep things light weight without downplaying	
	- Energiser - Form two rows: What animal does the animal do they remind you of?
		and why?
	- How do we share reflections/constructive feedback/energisers 
- Just creating awareness is not enough, so having agreements, decisions, with a conclusion
*** Post - session discussion, make them aware of the results while we are discussing ***

*** Check in the typeform with others and then send ***

With 15-20 people - need 2 trainers so the cost will be included in the budget....

(G) What about live or online/remotely etc.... 
(L) There are ways to accomodate hybrid but it would perhaps negatively affect

Jan. 2024 - Plan + Cost deatiled in the budget....

20-25 people, biggest room possible so that there is more focus, perhaps best to station it away
from the actual workplace...

- DEI events we have had answers where we have received negative comments
- We are reaching out with experts and we would like to share it with them (phrase)
