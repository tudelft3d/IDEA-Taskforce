#  IDEA discussion about the next event on Code of Conduct


**When:** 21st of January (so people are back from holidays), around noon but we will block 2h to have enough time


**Goal:** Create a CoC for the group by posing the right questions. 

**Format:** Let's see if we can use Miro so that also online people can add their thoughts. If the number of people cannot be supported by Miro we can be split them into groups with one facilitator per group to keep the time.


**Content:** In the first event we can start with a presentation about the TUD Code of Conduct and discuss its merits and drawbacks (eg lacking accountability and implementation)
Then we can have a list of values from the TUD Coc on the board and we ask what is missing. People can add their ideas on the board. 

In a later session we can discuss the values that come up from the first meeting and prioritize and refine them into our own CoC.

**Next Steps:** We will meet again on the 9th of Dec, until then all of us should read the TUD CoC and also look at at least one more CoC to collect ideas. We should also collect some ideas/questions on [a shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJ3yLXss9n9oJagVcUQFSpKzcXpMQrNX8dM7t4H4lIE/edit?tab=t.0)
