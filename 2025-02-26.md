## IDEA Meeting

### Agenda

1. Womens day celebration
2. Update about Diversability event that was cancelled (Siham)
3. Code of Conduct continuity
4. Next IDEA events
5. Continuity of IDEA events

### To do list

1. Quiz format for the womens day celebration
	- Same format as last time
	- Shared document for Questions with the right answer
	- Someone double checking the answers alongside fake answers that are equally likely
	- Used Kahoot for the quiz itself
	- Check availability
	- Geomatics meeting 13:00 to 14:00 when faculty might be busy
	- Gift? Budget? - (Ask Clara)
	- March 12 - 12:00 to 13:00 (Check with Amy & Shenglan)
	- Room and lunch reservation - Check with Sec. (mention for **section lunch**)

2. No contact yet about this but will reach out and then confirm what can be done about this
    
3. Some questions about this
	- Do we really need the code of conduct? Perhaps we instead say group values. The idea is that new employees can read and rely on it as a benchmark for instructions
	- We should perhaps put it all together? So many ideas from the last event so what to do about them?
	- Working session with the people who are wanting to further refine the miro board ideas
	- Conversation was useful but putting values on paper is any helpful? Parallels with the TUD CoC
	- As a reference document when troubling situations occur (be clear about the limitations of the document)
	- This document should be a parallel document like the "new employees" document
	
4. IDEA event for mental health support i.e., buddy system within the group. (Check with Joost since there is already a system in place) 
   Preventing burnout within the group - Short movies and discussion

5. How do we continue organised effort for IDEA related events? More of an open question/worry.
 	- Perhaps reach out individually for specific targets
	- Asking for help will be seen/perceived very differently
	- Possible number of stratergies
		- Simpler events
		- Follow-up people to organise events
		- Open-IDEA meeting - single topic
